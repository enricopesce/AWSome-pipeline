     * Set the `region`/`account` fields of `env` to either a concrete value to
     * select the indicated environment (recommended for production stacks), or to
     * the values of environment variables
     * `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`/`CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` to let the target environment
     * depend on the AWS credentials/configuration that the CDK CLI is executed
     * under (recommended for development stacks).
     *
     * If the `Stack` is instantiated inside a `Stage`, any undefined
     * `region`/`account` fields from `env` will default to the same field on the
     * encompassing `Stage`, if configured there.
     *
     * If either `region` or `account` are not set nor inherited from `Stage`, the
     * Stack will be considered "*environment-agnostic*"". Environment-agnostic
     * stacks can be deployed to any environment but may not be able to take
     * advantage of all features of the CDK. For example, they will not be able to
     * use environmental context lookups such as `ec2.Vpc.fromLookup` and will not
     * automatically translate Service Principals to the right format based on the
     * environment's AWS partition, and other such enhancements.

     * // Use the CLI's current credentials to determine the target environment:

     * // is configured to use (based on the user CLI credentials)

     *
     * // both of these stavks will use the stage's account/region:
